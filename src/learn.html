                <h2>What is Brainfuck?</h2>
                <p>
                    Brainfuck is a tiny programming language created in 1993 by Urban M&uuml;ller, a Swiss physics student.
                    His goal was simple: build the <strong>smallest possible compiler</strong> for a language that could still compute anything.
                    He succeeded, the first compiler was just 296 bytes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language has only <strong>8 instructions</strong>. That's it. No variables, no functions, no keywords.
                    Despite this, Brainfuck is <strong>Turing-complete</strong>, meaning it can theoretically compute anything that any other
                    programming language can. It's just... not very practical. And that's the point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brainfuck belongs to a family of languages called <strong>esoteric programming languages</strong> (or "esolangs"),
                    languages designed to be fun, weird, or challenging rather than useful for real work.

            <section id="the-machine">
                <h2>The Machine</h2>
                <p>Before we look at the instructions, you need to understand what a Brainfuck program works with. Think of it like a very simple machine with three parts:</p>

                <h3>1. The Tape</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine a long row of boxes stretching out to the right. Each box holds a single number. When the program starts,
                    every box contains <strong>0</strong>. There are 30,000 boxes in total (though you'll rarely need more than a handful).
                </p>
                <div class="tape-diagram">
                    <div class="cells">
                        <div class="cell">
                            <span>0</span>
                            <p>0</p>
                            <small>&nbsp;</small>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell">
                            <span>1</span>
                            <p>0</p>
                            <small>&nbsp;</small>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell">
                            <span>2</span>
                            <p>0</p>
                            <small>&nbsp;</small>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell">
                            <span>3</span>
                            <p>0</p>
                            <small>&nbsp;</small>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell faded">
                            <span>&hellip;</span>
                            <p>0</p>
                            <small>&nbsp;</small>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>2. The Pointer</h3>
                <p>
                    There's an arrow pointing at one of the boxes. It starts at the very first box (cell 0).
                    When we say "the current cell," we mean whichever box the pointer is pointing at right now.
                    You can move the pointer left and right along the tape.
                </p>

                <h3>3. The Numbers</h3>
                <p>
                    Each cell holds a number from <strong>0 to 255</strong>. That's it, no negative numbers, no huge numbers.
                    If you try to go above 255, it wraps back around to 0. If you try to go below 0, it wraps to 255.
                    Think of it like an odometer rolling over.

                <h2>Your First Program</h2>
                <p>Let's start with something small. This program outputs the letter <strong>A</strong> (ASCII value 65):</p>
                <pre data-bf="+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++."><code>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.</code></pre>
                <p>
                    That's 65 <code>+</code> signs followed by a <code>.</code> to print. The cell starts at 0, we add 1 sixty-five times to get 65,
                    and then we output it. The ASCII character for 65 is <code>A</code>.
                </p>
                <p>It works, but it's pretty tedious. There's a much better way...</p>
            </section>

            <section id="loops">
                <h2>Loops: The Key to Everything</h2>
                <p>Loops are what make Brainfuck actually usable. They let you repeat instructions without writing them out a thousand times.</p>

                <h3>How Loops Work</h3>
                <p>A loop is everything between <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>. Here are the rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the program hits <code>[</code>, it checks the <strong>current cell</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If the cell is <strong>0</strong>, the entire loop is skipped.</li>
                    <li>If the cell is <strong>not 0</strong>, the program enters the loop.</li>
                    <li>When it hits <code>]</code>, it checks the current cell again.</li>
                    <li>If the cell is <strong>not 0</strong>, it jumps back to the <code>[</code> and runs the loop again.</li>
                    <li>If the cell is <strong>0</strong>, it exits the loop and continues.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In other words, a loop keeps running <strong>as long as the current cell is not zero</strong>. It works just like a <code>while</code> loop in other languages.</p>

                <h3>Multiplication with Loops</h3>
                <p>Instead of pressing <code>+</code> sixty-five times, we can use multiplication. To print <code>A</code> (65), we can compute 13 &times; 5 = 65:</p>
                <pre data-bf="+++++++++++++[>+++++<-]>."><code>+++++++++++++  Set cell 0 to 13
[              While cell 0 is not 0:
  >+++++       Add 5 to cell 1
  <-           Go back; subtract 1 from cell 0
]              Cell 0 is now 0; cell 1 is 65
>.             Move to cell 1; print it (A)</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here's what happens: cell 0 starts at 13. Each time through the loop, we move right, add 5 to cell 1, move back left,
                    and subtract 1 from cell 0. After 13 loops, cell 0 is 0 (so the loop stops) and cell 1 is 13 &times; 5 = 65.
                </p>
                <p>Remember, any character that isn't one of the 8 instructions is ignored. So the words in the example above are just comments.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="ascii">
                <h2>ASCII: Numbers to Characters</h2>
                <p>
                    Brainfuck doesn't know about letters. It only knows numbers. The <code>.</code> instruction takes whatever number
                    is in the current cell and looks it up in the <strong>ASCII table</strong> to find the matching character.
                </p>
                <p>Here are some useful ASCII values to remember:</p>
                <div class="ascii-reference">
                    <div><code>10</code> = newline</div>
                    <div><code>32</code> = space</div>
                    <div><code>48-57</code> = digits 0-9</div>
                    <div><code>65-90</code> = A-Z</div>
                    <div><code>97-122</code> = a-z</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <strong>A common mistake:</strong> the <code>,</code> (input) instruction stores the <em>ASCII value</em> of whatever
                    you type, not the number itself. If you type <code>2</code>, the cell gets 50 (the ASCII code for the
                    character '2'), not the number 2. Pressing Enter on an empty input gives you 10 (newline).
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="common-patterns">
                <h2>Common Patterns</h2>
                <p>Over the years, Brainfuck programmers have discovered small patterns that act as building blocks. Here are the most important ones:</p>

                <h3>Clear a Cell</h3>
                <pre data-bf="+++++[-]"><code>[-]</code></pre>
                <p>This keeps subtracting 1 until the cell reaches 0. It works no matter what value the cell starts with (because of wrapping, even 255 eventually reaches 0).</p>

                <h3>Move a Value</h3>
                <pre data-bf="+++++[->+<]"><code>[->+<]</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This moves the value from the current cell into the next cell. Each loop iteration subtracts 1 from here and adds 1 over there.
                    When it's done, the original cell is 0 and the next cell has the value. <strong>Warning:</strong> this destroys the original value.
                </p>

                <h3>Copy a Value</h3>
                <pre data-bf="+++++[->+>+<<]>>[-<<+>>]"><code>[->+>+<<]>>[-<<+>>]</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Copying is trickier because reading a cell destroys it. The trick is to move the value into <em>two</em> cells (a target and a temporary),
                    then move the temporary copy back. After this, the original cell is preserved and the next cell holds a copy.
                </p>

                <h2>Hello World: Step by Step</h2>
                <p>Here's how the classic Brainfuck "Hello World" works. The strategy is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use a loop to set up several cells with values close to the ASCII codes we need.</li>
                    <li>Fine-tune each cell with a few <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> adjustments.</li>
                    <li>Print each character by moving to the right cell and using <code>.</code></li>
                </ol>
                <pre data-bf="++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>."><code>++++++++++           Set cell 0 to 10 (loop counter)
[                    Loop 10 times:
  >+++++++           Add 7 to cell 1
  >++++++++++        Add 10 to cell 2
  >+++               Add 3 to cell 3
  >+                 Add 1 to cell 4
  <<<<-              Go back to cell 0; subtract 1
]
                     After the loop:
                     Cell 0 = 0
                     Cell 1 = 70
                     Cell 2 = 100
                     Cell 3 = 30
                     Cell 4 = 10

>++.                 Cell 1: 70 plus 2 = 72       (H)
>+.                  Cell 2: 100 plus 1 = 101     (e)
+++++++..            Cell 2: 101 plus 7 = 108     (l; printed twice)
+++.                 Cell 2: 108 plus 3 = 111     (o)
>++.                 Cell 3: 30 plus 2 = 32       (space)
<<+++++++++++++++.   Cell 1: 72 plus 15 = 87      (W)
>.                   Cell 2: 111                  (o)
+++.                 Cell 2: 111 minus 3 = 114    (r)
------.              Cell 2: 114 minus 6 = 108    (l)
--------.            Cell 2: 108 minus 8 = 100    (d)
>+.                  Cell 3: 32 plus 1 = 33       (!)
>.                   Cell 4: 10                   (newline)</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The multiplication loop does the heavy lifting. Instead of pressing <code>+</code> 72 times for 'H',
                    we compute 10 &times; 7 = 70 and just add 2. Clever, right?

            <section id="nested-loops">
                <h2>Nested Loops</h2>
                <p>
                    Loops can go inside other loops. Each <code>[</code> matches with its corresponding <code>]</code>.
                    The interpreter keeps track of which brackets go together, so nesting works exactly like you'd expect.
                </p>
                <pre data-bf="+++[>+++[>+<-]<-]"><code>+++       Cell 0 = 3 (outer counter)
[         Outer loop (runs 3 times):
  >+++    Cell 1 = 3 (inner counter; reset each time)
  [       Inner loop (runs 3 times):
    >+    Add 1 to cell 2
    <-    Subtract 1 from cell 1
  ]       Inner loop ends when cell 1 = 0
  <-      Subtract 1 from cell 0
]         Outer loop ends when cell 0 = 0</code></pre>
                <p>After this runs, cell 2 contains 9 (3 &times; 3). The inner loop runs 3 times for each of the 3 outer iterations.</p>

                <h2>A Bit of History</h2>
                <p>
                    Urban M&uuml;ller created Brainfuck in 1993 after being inspired by the FALSE programming language, which had a compiler
                    that fit in 1,024 bytes. He wanted to go smaller. His compiler, written in Motorola 68000 assembly for the Amiga,
                    came in at just 296 bytes. A later version shrunk it to 240 bytes. Brian Raiter later wrote a Linux compiler in only 166 bytes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mathematically, Brainfuck (minus the I/O instructions) is a minor variation of a language called P'', created by
                    Italian computer scientist Corrado B&ouml;hm in 1964, the first language proven to be Turing-complete without
                    using goto-style jumps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Brainfuck has inspired hundreds of derivative esolangs- Ook! (written in orangutan sounds), COW (bovine-themed),
                    Brainloller (commands encoded as pixel colors in images), and many more.
