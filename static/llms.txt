# Brainfuck.net

> A free, browser-based Brainfuck interpreter, text encoder, and visual step-through debugger.

Brainfuck.net lets users write, run, and debug Brainfuck code entirely in the browser. It features syntax highlighting with color-coded operators, a visual debugger that steps through execution one instruction at a time showing memory cells and pointer position, an ASCII table reference, and a text-to-Brainfuck encoder that generates optimized code using dynamic programming.

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created by Urban Mueller in 1993. It operates on a 30,000-cell array of 8-bit integers using only 8 instructions: + - > < [ ] . ,

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for all 8 Brainfuck operators
- Code execution with output display
- Visual step-through debugger with memory cell grid and pointer visualization
- Step forward, backward, and auto-play controls
- User input support for the , (comma) operator via modal prompt
- ASCII table (0-255) reference
- Text-to-Brainfuck encoder with optimized code generation
- Learn Brainfuck instruction reference
